I graduated from Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University in 2018. My advisors are Professor Franziska Michor and Professor James M. Robins. My current research lies in nonparametric, semiparametric and high-dimensional statistics, robust statistical methods, causal inference, computational and mathematical biology.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the School of Life Sciences at Tongji University, under the supervision of Professor Yong Zhang.

I will be joining the \href{Institute of Natural Sciences (INS)}{https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/} at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Fall 2020.

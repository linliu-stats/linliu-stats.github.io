I graduated from Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University in 2018. My advisors are Professor Franziska Michor and Professor James M. Robins. My current research lies in nonparametric, semiparametric and high-dimensional statistics, robust statistical methods, causal inference, computational and mathematical biology.

I will be joining the Institute of Natural Sciences (INS) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Fall 2020.

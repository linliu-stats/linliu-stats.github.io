I am a postdoc fellow in the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard University. I graduated from Harvard University. My advisor is James M. Robins. My current research lies in nonparametric, semiparametric and high-dimensional statistics, robust statistical methods, causal inference, computational and mathematical biology.

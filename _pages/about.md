I graduated from the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) in 2018. My advisors are [Professor Franziska Michor](http://michorlab.dfci.harvard.edu/) and [Professor James M. Robins](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/james-robins/). My current research lies in nonparametric, semiparametric and high-dimensional statistics, robust statistical methods, causal inference, computational and mathematical biology.

I am also interested in the theory of deep learning, estimation and inference in inverse problems and applying causal inference tools in biomedical research.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the [School of Life Sciences at Tongji University](https://life.tongji.edu.cn/lifeen/), under the supervision of [Professor Yong Zhang](https://zhanglab.tongji.edu.cn).

I will be joining the [Institute of Natural Sciences (INS)](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in Fall 2020. I will also be affiliated with the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.sjtu.edu.cn/) and the [SJTU-YALE Joint Center for Biostatistics](http://transmed.sjtu.edu.cn/ylhome.do?method=getHomeList&version=en).

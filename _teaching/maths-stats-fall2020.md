Tentative plan
------
I have an ambitious plan to cover within one semester. As a result, I may leave some of the topics to homework problems for you to explore.

Part I: Parametric statistics

Sufficient and ancillary statistics, Efficiency theory for maximum likelihood estimation, Cramer-Rao lower bound, Regression, M-estimation, Z-estimation, Parametric Bayesian inference

Part II: Nonparametric and semiparametric statistics

Resampling (bootstrap, jackknife, permutation), Influence functions, Semiparametric efficiency, Gaussian and Empirical processes, Function spaces and approximation theory

Part III: Minimax lower bounds 

Lower bounds for testing, estimation, and inference, adaptative testing, estimation and inference

Part V: Other topics

High dimensional statistics and compressive sensing, Causal inference, Deep neural networks

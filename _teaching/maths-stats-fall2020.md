Course overview
------

Most of mathematical statistics courses use the classic textbook "Statistical Inference" by Casella Berger

My goal is to cover the most important ideas and results in the classical parametric statistics in the first month of the semester and jump into the modern tools and techniques in mathematical statistics used in research.

Tentative plan
------
I have an ambitious plan to cover within one semester. As a result, I may leave some of the topics to homework problems for you to explore.

Part I: Parametric statistics

Sufficient and ancillary statistics, Efficiency theory for maximum likelihood estimation, Neyman-Pearson lemma, Cramer-Rao lower bound, Regression, M-estimation, Z-estimation, Parametric Bayesian inference

Part II: Nonparametric and semiparametric statistics

Resampling (bootstrap, jackknife, permutation), Influence functions and von Mises calculus, Semiparametric efficiency, Gaussian and Empirical processes, Function spaces and approximation theory, U-statistics and V-statistics

Part III: Minimax lower bounds 

Lower bounds for testing, estimation, and inference, adaptative testing, estimation and inference

Part V: Other topics

High dimensional statistics and compressive sensing, Causal inference, Deep neural networks
